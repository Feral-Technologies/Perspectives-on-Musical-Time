# Perspectives-on-Musical-Time

Example patches to accompany a paper by Paul Vandemast-Bell and John Ferguson titled 'Perspectives on Musical Time and Human/Machine Agency in the Development of Performance Systems for Live Electronic Music'. This was presented at University of Westminster (UK) as part of Innovation In Music conference 2017 http://www.musicinnovation.co.uk.

The patches were created using Pure data (vanilla) by John Ferguson, an overview can be found here: https://vimeo.com/233279073 These patches are intended as practical/experimental starting points for exploration beyond the conventions of grid-based musical time that are common in much electronic music.

Pure data is required, this free and open source software is available from Miller Puckette: http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html
