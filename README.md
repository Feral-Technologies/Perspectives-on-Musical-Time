# Perspectives-on-Musical-Time

Example patches to accompany a paper by Paul Vandemast-Bell and John Ferguson titled 'Perspectives on Musical Time and Human/Machine Agency in the Development of Performance Systems for Live Electronic Music'. This was presented 8th September 2017 at University of Westminster (UK) as part of Innovation In Music (#InMusic17) http://www.musicinnovation.co.uk.

The patches included in this repository were created by John Ferguson using Pure data (vanilla) , an overview of the contents can be found here: https://vimeo.com/233279073. These are intended as practical/experimental starting points for exploration beyond the conventions of grid-based musical time that are common in much electronic music. For performance documentation of a project that makes uses of these techniques see: https://vimeo.com/200625002. 

Pure data is required to run teh patches, this free and open-source software is available from Miller Puckette: http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html.
